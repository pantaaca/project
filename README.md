# 🎓 Engineering Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio of projects developed during my studies on Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Nis.  
This repository showcases my hands-on experience in **Embedded Systems**, **IoT**, **Digital & Analog Electronics** and **RF Electronic**.

## 📌 About Me

I'm a motivated and detail-oriented electrical engineer with a strong interest in embedded systems, firmware development, and automation.  
Through these projects, I gained practical experience in:

- Microcontrollers (ESP32 NodeMCU, Arduino Uno R3, Arduino MEGA2560, STM32F750DK, RasperryPi 4)
- C/C++ firmware development
- IoT communication protocols (HTTP, MQTT, Blynk, WiFi, TCP/IP)
- PCB design and prototyping
- Soldering and hardware debugging
- Working with sensors (**ADXL345**, **4-channel Relay Modul**, **Ultra-Sonic Sensor HC-SR04**, **Metal sensor LJ12A3-4-Z-BY**, **IR transmitter and receiver**)

## 📁 Projects Overview

Here’s a short summary of the folders in this repository:

**ADXL345_stm32f750dk** - A project demonstrating the use of the ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer with the STM32F750DK development board. It includes sensor initialization, data acquisition, and display.

**UVM_project** - A verification project using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) in SystemVerilog, intended for testing digital designs in ASIC/FPGA workflows.

**Amplifier_AWR** - A design and simulation of a high-frequency amplifier using AWR Microwave Office. It includes schematic, gain analysis, and stability check.

**Chebyshev_filter_AWR** - Design and simulation of a Chebyshev filter in AWR, featuring frequency response, S-parameters, and layout structure for RF applications.

**HomeMade_solar_panel** - A video demonstration of building a solar panel system with Diode (1N4007 and BZX55b), showcasing basic construction and energy output.

**RaspberryPi_camera_server** - A guide to building a simple camera server using Raspberry Pi. Covers software setup, video streaming, and remote access.

**Realisation_of_smart_dustbin** -  Smart trash bin project using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor, capable of detecting garbage levels and responding automatically.

**Realisation_smart_switch** - Description of a smart switch controlled via IR and Wi-Fi (ESP32) and Mobile application (Blynk), with circuit diagrams and application use cases.

> Each project includes circuit diagrams, source code, and explanation files where available.

## 🚀 Goal

These projects reflect my passion for building real-world systems that combine hardware and software. I am constantly learning and looking forward to applying my skills in a professional setting.
