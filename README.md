# 🎓 Engineering Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio of projects developed during my studies on Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Nis.  
This repository showcases my hands-on experience in **Embedded Systems**, **IoT**, **Digital & Analog Electronics**and **RF**.

## 📌 About Me

I'm a motivated and detail-oriented electrical engineer with a strong interest in embedded systems, firmware development, and automation.  
Through these projects, I gained practical experience in:

- Microcontrollers (ESP32 NodeMCU, Arduino Uno R3, Arduino MEGA2560, STM)
- C/C++ firmware development
- IoT communication protocols (HTTP, MQTT, Blynk, WiFi)
- PCB design and prototyping
- Soldering and hardware debugging
- Working with sensors, relays, IR receivers, and RF modules

## 📁 Projects Overview

Here’s a short summary of the folders in this repository:

- `Smart_Switch_IR` – IR remote-controlled smart switch using Arduino Uno and relay
- `Smart_Socket_ESP32` – Web-controlled socket via ESP32 acting as Access Point
- `Smart_Socket_Blynk` – ESP32-based socket controlled via Blynk IoT app and IR remote
- `Line_Follower` – Basic autonomous robot using IR sensors
- `RFID_Access` – RFID card-based access control system
- `Automotive_Tools` – Car sensor monitoring and diagnostics (CAN-based)
- `Misc_Tools` – Small utility projects and experiments

> Each project includes circuit diagrams, source code, and explanation files where available.

## 🚀 Goal

These projects reflect my passion for building real-world systems that combine hardware and software. I am constantly learning and looking forward to applying my skills in a professional setting.
